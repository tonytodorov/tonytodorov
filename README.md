I am a self-motivated Java Web Development student. I have been involved in the development of a project related to the recreation of a board game.

The project is a prototype of the popular board game Dungeon&Dragons. The game starts with the creation of a character, after that he has to kill a certain number of monsters to advance to the next level. During this time, the character can collect items with which can create weapons, armor for his main purpose - to kill final monster. My main responsibility was database development.
